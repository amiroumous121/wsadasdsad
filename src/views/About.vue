    <p class="text-center mt-5">
      Meet Amir Zandieh, a dedicated and passionate student pursuing a
      Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security. While many would be content to focus
      solely on their major, Amir's insatiable curiosity led him to explore the
      world of web development, specifically Vue 3. This website is a testament
      to his hard work, dedication, and relentless pursuit of knowledge. Built
      over a span of just three months, this platform serves as both a portfolio
      and a learning journey, encapsulating the essence of Amir's commitment to
      his craft.

      Amir's interest in Cyber Security was always evident, but what sets him
      apart is his ability to integrate this knowledge with other tech stacks.
      He believes that understanding web development can provide a more holistic
      view of the digital world, a perspective that is crucial for anyone
      specializing in Cyber Security. This led him to dive into Vue 3, a
      progressive framework for building user interfaces.

      The journey wasn't easy. Juggling between his rigorous academic schedule,
      personal commitments, and this project was a Herculean task. But Amir was
      up for the challenge. He spent countless nights reading documentation,
      watching tutorials, and most importantly, coding. Each line of code added
      to this website was a step closer to his goal, each bug fixed was a lesson
      learned, and each feature implemented was a milestone achieved.

      tireless days. This website is more than just a collection of web pages;

      testament to his resolve. It showcases not just his skills in Vue 3 but
      also his understanding of user experience, design principles, and most
      importantly, his knack for solving problems.

      will continue to evolve. It will not only reflect his growing skills but
      also his expanding horizons. For Amir, learning is a never-ending process,
      and this website is just the beginning. He is excited about the endless
      possibilities that lie ahead and is eager to tackle new challenges, learn
      new skills, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
